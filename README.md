## Introduction
The goal of this project is to utilize the skills obtained over the past three months of hard work and dedication in this intense data science bootcamp. Since the beginning of my time in the program, I have been exploring the concept of **urban farming** with consideration to my background in biology and agriculture. Urban farming is a complex subject; a revolutionary approach to agriculture due to its non-renewable resource reduction (water) but with a caveat in regards to the energy usage urban farms need in order to be feasible. An urban farm that has impact on its community is a farm that can continuously produce fresh produce year round without interruption. A simple garden on top of a building or in an amenity space, as we have seen in some areas, is not sufficient. The concept of urban agriculture is an industry disrupting idea, but one that I feel must take place in order to reduce food insecurity and transportation emissions, improve food safety, create food independence, and a host of other issues related to the difficulties we face with traditional ag.
